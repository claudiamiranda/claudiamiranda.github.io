					<h2><b>LUMINOUS EMPTINESS</b></h2>

				</section>

				<section>
<h4>WHAT</h4>
				An interactive digital mirror that visualises the experience of having your sense of self dissolve and promotes a detachment from a fixed identity
				</section>

				<section>
<h4>WHY</h4>
				<i>Emptiness is a mode of perception, a way of looking at experience. It adds nothing to, and takes nothing away from, the raw data of physical and mental events. You look at events in the mind and the senses with no thought of whether thereâ€™s anything lying behind them.</i>

				<h4>POTENTIAL DIRECTION #1</h4><br>mirror image is distorted unless your eyes are covered, you are only "yourself" when your eyes are covered. there would be a delay in the visualisation, like playing peekaboo with yourself.<br>

<h4>POTENTIAL DIRECTION #2</h4><br>camera captures your image and projects it onto a glass or skrim that translates your image into a visualization.<br>

	<h2>SO MANY QUESTIONS</h2>
</section>

<section>
	<ul>
<li>	what does it look like? is it a projector or video screen?
<li>	how big is it? is there sound? how bright is it? what color is it?
<li>	what type of aesthetic?
<li>	will the placement of the camera cause an issue with face recognition?
<li>	does it look like a person? is the face distorted?
<li>	do i need to use face recognition or is it enough to detect a shape and distort the video?
<li>	how many people fit into the screen? ill it break if there are multiple people in frame?
<li>	is there a delay? how long is the experience?
<li>	can it be recreated on anything with a camera?
<li>	how long does someone have to stand in front of the camera/screen?
<li>	how will it be interactive? is there something to touch? a gesture?
<li>	what does it look like for the observer?
<li>	what does it look from far away like when nobody is interacting with the piece?
</ul>
